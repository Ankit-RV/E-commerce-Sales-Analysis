# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis
Helped a Brazilian E-commerce store to understand how their sales trend across different states over the years and why

## Process
For this analysis, they given the data for the time period 2016-2018.

For the analysis I created different metrics like sales, customer acquisition, total no. of orders for each year across the different states they serve. Using these metrics I identified the top 2 states which show: 
* i. Declining trend over the years.
* ii. Increasing trend over the years.
* Also identified the Root cause analysis for their performance across a variety of metrics
